# StepCounter
Simple Step Counter that you can trust it won't steal your information. It will not do anything funky other than store the step count on your phone

Just clone the project, cd inside the folder and run <code>npm install</code>.
You will need to run an emulator to see it working, since it uses <a href="https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/">capacitor</a> and <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">cordova</a> to use native components of the phone, like the accelerometer.
